# EmployeeTracker

## Description

This application is a content management system which allows a user to manage their company's employees using node and MySql.  
Through the command line interface the user can add departments, position, and employees letting the full structure of a company
be represented and tracked then have that information stored on a database.  Once information is added employees positions can also
be edited if changes occure within the company structure.  Using the CLI you can view the data for departments, employees and their positions.
Future updates will include the ability to delete departments, positions, employees, sort employees by manager and update whom their manager is
and also show the total budget of a department.
